# BuyAndSell

It's my first NodeJS project. I did some courses in Udemy,codeschool and a read some documentations before start it.

How it works?
	It's simple, first you signup and then you login , after that you can create, update and delete a product.

I'm using an Online MongoDB.

I deployed it on heroku, [click here](https://warm-oasis-34963.herokuapp.com/) to acess.

### Install instructions

	1. npm i
	2. nodemon app
	3. go to localhost:8080
	4. that's it! :)
